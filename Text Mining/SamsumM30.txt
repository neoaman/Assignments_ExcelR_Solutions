"Don't fall for the  negative reviews. This is best at the price. People following red mi phones but this has bigger advantage. I will write only advantages and cons and feedback Advantage-Amoled display.-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.-Wide angle camera is awsum.-No heating no lagging.-Face unlock is very fast.-Mainly look is stunning.....-Very low radiation-Blue light filter-Lock screen story and stunning pics.Cons-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.-Online availability.(Now in stock)-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?Feedbackfeedback-People say camera but I find it's too good.-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43After Using for 1 week-All well and amazing.-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.

"Last few months I am using this mobile performance wise not bad, if you download any file you can't find where it saved.Display -ok not full HD,Audio- LowSpeed - you can't play any online games it will be very slow. Earphone -not available.Cam-Good, Totally it is an average product, you can use for only calls and watching movies, Phone contains fiber body, we have to handle carefully.

"I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

"A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera & a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography & great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.Samsung M30 hasExynos 7904 Processor1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor & 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.

"Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it

"Bought it in the 1st sale. Using for 3rd day now and what i feel is ..Elegant  looks.Display quality is brilliant.Cameras are lovely. And charging speed is great thanks to inbox 15w charger. For a average regular user having not much  interest  of playing games I would definitely recommend  this. Moreover, design is literally premium and and finally Brand is Samsung <U+0001F600>
            "
"I was lucky enough to get this Amazing device in the very first sale on 7th March and that too my desirable variant ! <U+0001F60A> The delivery was also fast. Thanks to Amazon ! <U+0001F44D>The phone is definitely a True Value For Money as it offers great specs along with great features with an attractive price tag. Let me organise my views about this amazing phone  as follows...LOOKS : <U+0001F50E><U+0001F4F2><U+0001F44D>The mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.CAMERA : <U+0001F4F8> <U+0001F44D>It has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.DISPLAY : <U+0001F4F1><U+0001F44D>6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.MULTI TASKING : <U+0001F4DA><U+0001F44D>With it's huge 6GB RAM and 128GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.BATTERY : <U+0001F50B><U+0001F914>Battery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge cycles.Though, Fast charging from it's 15 watt charger (type C port) is indeed capable of charging the phone really fast.EXTRAS : <U+0001F4DD>Besides all those stated above, I would like to add some more bullet points...<U+0001F44D><U+0001F539>The Face recognition works great ! There's a lighting animation around the front camera while it tries to identity your face. Looks nice.<U+0001F539> Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive. You can activate a setting after which you can scroll down the notification tray by sliding your finger on the Fingerprint sensor only !<U+0001F539> The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good. Though, I felt it a bit low when I recorded my voice on star maker app.<U+0001F539> Has dedicated slots for 2 Sims and 1 Memory card.<U+0001F539> Packed with all the needed sensors.<U+0001F44E><U+0001F539>I found no option of assigning a SIM to a specific contact.<U+0001F539> The back panel is plastic and it's kind of finger print magnet.<U+0001F539> The Do Not Disturb function doesn't mute the phone completely though it says so. Instead, I click on the Speaker icon to mute in notification tray.<U+0001F539> No Gorilla glass protection for the display.<U+0001F539> It's not water resistant.<U+0001F539> It doesn't have an Always On Display.<U+0001F539> No Slow Motion video recording feature.<U+0001F539> Runs on Android 8.1. Don't know when will it get the Pie update.Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later ! <U+0001F60A>

"First things first,The phone is not for everyone. You may be thinking you should get a gaming phone at this price. But it is not.However, the good news is that there are other good phones in this price range if you are looking for a gaming device and especially looking to buy it for playing PUBG. Trust me, do not buy this phone if you are into gaming.So, who should buy the device? Any non-gamer user who loves other aspects of the phone such as a display, battery, camera and so on.DisplayThe display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30. It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. But that doesn't mean POCO F1 display is bad. At 15K, you are getting one heck of a deal when it comes to the display.Another thing that I noticed is the great body to screen ration. It almost covers the whole screen.Processor and RAMAs we said earlier, the processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me and you, who love to do calls, read messages and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. It will not go slow while using the available RAM(4GB in my case).Battery5000mAh battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then the phone is for you. Also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battery last longer.CameraI didn't test camera that much. But, it does look nice. You can take nice photos. But the camera does not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 15K.OSI tried Samsung OS for the first time. I found it pretty decent, but not outstanding. You need to navigate multiple times for basic features. But, the good thing is that the UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for.In shortDisplay: One of the bestBattery: 5000mAh, more than enough for heavy one day use. Can easily last two days for normal users.Processor + RAM: Great for normal users, not great for gamers.OS: DecentOverall rating: 8.5/10
            "
"This is the best phone i found at this price range. I just loved it. It is super fast and the screen is just beautiful thanks to the Amoled fhd display. The fast charging charges the phone in no time. More ever the 5000 mah battery is a just incredible at the end of day i have around 30% juice remaining!!!! For a pubg lover like me... All i can say is the phone is very very smooth no lags, no frame drops and the big screen gives the best experience <U+0001F60D>. I also liked the front camera which clicks amazing selfies coming to the back camera its just Lit!! The photos look real and natural colours are preserved as well. All i can say is its a stunning phone worth the price.... Loved it!!!
            "
"I am giving 1 star for Amazon service and 2 star for this phone camera quality is not better and  I used two days heating problem comes.  If you buy this phone from Amazon then it will not be replaceable and returned because a smart check app made for phone performance checking,  it always shows right in all parameters. In this way you won't be able to replace / return this phone. So I suggest Dont purchase this phone Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon if it defective found it won't be replaced
            "
"It's just the 3rd day and proximity sensor is not working in this device and ear piece is heating up while on call. Phone is slow and not a right choice for 15k. Please consider other brand products this phone is not good for regular usage as well.
            "
"I have chosen this product over other mobiles in this price range for below reasons :1. Big battery(5000mah -others have only 4000mah)2. Triple card slot(believe me this matters though we tend to ignore this point but for those who use double sim ... we would definitely need to use both sims and one memory chip)3. Super amoled display (again other mobiles simply don't have it)4. Fast charging + fast charger in-the- box5. Wide angle camera- useful for big family photos6. Samsung trust factorNow after using our fire two full days below are pros and cons I found :Pros:---------1. Battery - Simply awesome. I first charged it yesterday 9.30 AM (100%). Since I did below tasks throughout yesterday and today and it went to 10% today at 6.44 PM  ( so 1 day & 9 hrs) :  <U+25AA> Audio calls  <U+25AA> video calls  <U+25AA> internet browsing  <U+25AA> listening to songs (headphone and speaker both)  <U+25AA> watching movie (Netflix) and YouTube  <U+25AA> setting up phone( usual setting for a new phone - so basically screen was on)  <U+25AA> playing games( asphalt 9, dead target,  fruit ninja) - all games ran without single stutter2. Screen- simply beautifulBeing amoled display it show very deep colours which u won't see in normal fhd lcd/tft displays.As soon as u will see other mobiles without amoled u will notice the difference.3. UI is smooth and gestures are nice.4. Always on display gives our result premium look ( though our drains battery faster)5. Headphone quality is very nice6. Call quality is also very nice( the most important feature of any phone but we least bother about it nowadays <U+0001F609>)7. Charging time nice for 5000 mah battery- 2.15 hrs >> 10% to 100%)8. Camera is decent (not the best int this price range)Cons:---------1. Processor works fine though but i felt slight stutters here n there (but fortunately it worked really nice for three games i played as mentioned above)2. Camera doesn't perform well in low light conditions) [but works great in day light]Till now i m seriously enjoying using this phone even people in my office are appreciating our thanks to its stunning display.For me its truly practical phone for my requirement as I m not a serious gamer but i will post  updated review on 18th before its next sale on 19th so that u can decide if this phone is for you or not

" Got a faulty Samsung M30 phone.After two weeks of using found that the camera stopped working.Camera Issue:When we click on camera icon blank screen is coming.Lag issue:Sometimes on touching on any icon an evident delay is happening.With all these issues reported given to service centerThings done in service center: - Updated OS - Replaced cameraStill the issue is not fixed.Now they told they will replaced the panel and check. Still haven't found any problem. When requested for replacement with all these valid problems not replacing the faulty phone.Very rude people working for Samsung customer care. Worst experience with that also.IMPORTANT NOTE:Attached video of those problems. Please refer it... Can attach only one videoNew Update:Finally they have replaced the board and the problem was fixed...And they gave me 6 months extended warranty.Though didn't get a device replacement.

Just went black,and touch was still working. Worse customer service but finally got my refund (replacement wasn't even available) today. It also has a crap processor. It lagged when switching apps. Go for note 7 pro,way better buy than this.

"Worst camera quality. Both front & back cameras are not up to the mark .\"Face recognition\" is also slow.Screen, Look, battery is gud. But picture quality is too bad.
            "
"When it comes to Samsung M30, you know you're in a good deal. From the display to the look of it, I love every single bit of it. The blue gradient color is one to look out of for. When it comes to using it, you have a power packed device in your hand. Powered with Android 8.1, it is the latest one in the market making it already a favourite. When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students

"Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing \"SAMSUNG GALAXY M30\" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

"Samsung galaxy M30 is the lowest priced smart phone with 3 back cameras.It has a 16mp front camera with focus which is seen very less in any smartphone below 18,000 INR M30 also gives a 5000 MaH battery so we get a better battery back up and use the phone all day without any need to charge.Phone comes with a amoled display so the contrast and the characters are really sharp and the screen looks really beautiful.The 6gb ram and 128GB RAM will make your phone run faster than ever you can play any game in your phone so your gaming experience is going to be really good and The phone is really light you wont even feel any weight on your pockets when you roam around and looks of the phone is mind blowing overall Samsung galaxy M30 is a delight to have in your hands If your budget is under 20000 it is your go to phone

"So yeah talking about samsung M30 its just amazing with new classic look you can say the phone is of next generation and pretty amazing with its features.

"After 4months using of this mobiles set, I am writing my this feedback.  Samsung M30 processing is slow, it's finger print senser and face detection features are not upto the mark. Its Battery which is 5000AmH, does not seem powerful battery, it's performance is equal to 2800-3000AmH battery, it get s drained very fast watching videos. If you charge its battery 100% then it comes down 97% within 30 minutes without using the phone.Camera quality is also not good, there is no sense of rear triple camera.This is only Brand Tag Samsung but over all quality of this phone is not good. It is not worthwhile to o spend Rs 15000 for this \"GHATIYA\" mobile.So if somebody wants to buy M30, don't buy it. Better should go for Redmi note 7 pro/ Honor or Vivo
            "
"Loving the m30. Super light and easy to hold thanks to its curved design. Sometimes the screen gets a little cut off at the corners but that's okay. Great customisation. Battery is pretty great. Love that the headphone Jack and the charging point is on the same end and that it has a dedicated slot. Finger print  scanner and face detection is a little dull. Can't lock my phone with finger print like I could on my Moto G5s+. Also the speaker kinda resounds, as though you were in a closed room. Also camera is pretty average, hating the beauty mode. Touch sensitivity can also be a little awkward sometimes in the corners. All in all it's a decent phone, great battery life so for basic users who don't play games sometimes or all the time. It's a great handset to have invested in. However, it suits my basic needs, so I'm all for it.
            "
"Pros:-  Made in India.  Big battery (5,000 mAh)  Fast charging support (fast charger is included in the box)  Type-C charging port  6.4inches FHD+ Super AMOLED display with infinity-U cut design  Tripple Slot(Two SIM cards+Memory Card simultaneously)  Tripple Cameras (13MP+5MP+5MP)  Front camera 16MP(f/1.9)Cons:-  Plastic body instead of metal  Less powerful processor compare to other phones in same price range  Design should be improved as device is slippery  Camera in low light is average compare to other new phones in same price rangeGood phone in this budget and trust of Samsung makes it more reliable.

"The mobile is getting struck and it's taking 3 hours for full charge from less than 10% to 100% with 15W fast charger given by them in the box....Then there's no point of fast charging here...In 3 hours any phone wil get fully charged with any charger...Then wats the point here saying fast charger and 3x faster and all...

"THE WORST PHONE THAT I'VE EVER USED!!Purchased on : April 2, 2019Received on : April 4, 2019I actually brought Samsung Galaxy M30 on March 12 (flash sale)... The phone died in just 6 days... The phone didn't turn on again... I requested a replacement for the product, but it was not in stock... So amazon refunded my money on Amazon Pay... I purchased M30 again (on April 2, 2019)... The phone died again just within 2 days!! The screen turned off automatically while I was using it... I tried to turn it on thinking that this might be an accidental switch off... My phone had a charge around 57%... But when I tried to turn on, nothing happened... I plugged a charger into it, it just showed a circle with a lighting symbol (<U+26A1>) in it... The same thing had happened with my first M30... Now I've requested for a refund from amazon... I trusted Samsung a lot... But it BROKE MY TRUST WITHIN BLINKS!!! NEVER BUY A SAMSUNG PHONE!!!

"The first thing that noticed while unboxing was the gradant look samsung gave to the phone it was just awesome <U+0001F60D>. The battery is just outstanding 5000mah with normal usage it lasts about 2-3 days. Gamers go for it the super amoled display gives a marvellous experience in gaming. The first phone in market with triple camera in this range it has one depth camera the close up shots are just yoo good and the wide angle camera captures outstanding images. The selfies are just super awesome with great quality. 6.4 inch comes with infinity display just loved it.The phone never had lagging issues the games like pubg ran very smoothly<U+2714>The fingerprint sensor also responds with second or less.samsung always comes with the great picture quality also this time the picture quality i love it the triple cameras are just best to capture life's unforgettable moments.Just a great piece of advice from your brother in this price range there is no other like Samsung. Just go for it <U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D><U+0001F60D>The M30 and M series are just killing it great price ,great specs,quality,and the brand Samsung just loved it <U+270B><U+0001F60D><U+2714>\"

"Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.Front camera is ok and take decent photos.there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.Video mode has literally no features.just point and shoot.Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.
            "
"Overall  phone is good at this price..The camera is not as expect.

"I am very disappointed with this phone from Samsung M30. I am using it for more 7 days and here is why I am reviewing bad:- Phone heats up while playing PUBG;- Display is not good at all. Mi is no doubt way better.- Battery is 5000mah as they say but does not work like that. Even in week 1, it died very easily.<U+2028><U+2028>Another reason to give 1 is because Frapp, which asked us to buy this product didn’t pay my stipend earlier. They acted as Fraud company.

"Best phone to get rid of those Chinese options. Phone is manufactured in India and comes with a trust of brand Samsung. With M series Samsung have overcome it's all time drawback of not giving powerful battery. Camera and sound quality is excellent. Face recognition is quick. Screen is superb, in any light and at any angle. Feel of phone is solid and doesn't give feel of plastic. Gradient back panel looks awesome.
            "
"This is a good product, but I want to return it because this does not fulfill my important need. I have been using Galaxy series phones because of Samsung Knox, and after getting this product I discovered that this product does not support Knox, so I have no use for this.But I am surprised that they launch this new series and keep an important feature out? really disappointed.
            "
"Doesn't seems to be 5000 mah battery drains very fast,frequent advertisement,mobile is very slow.screen is not protected by gorilla glass 5 or 6 for better screen life.Camera quality also not upto the mark comparing to note 7 pro.One good thing is AMOLED display which looks very premium in hand.
            "
"I'll head straight to my likes and dislikes.Likes:1. Massive Battery: The back up is really good. For a regular user, easily a day and half's juice.2. Fast Charging: Takes about 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 10%. Yes 2 hours is a lot but even the battery is large.3. Camera: Does a good job. I was on a fix after checking Redmi Note 7 Pro's camera samples, but trust me the shots are equally good, and the front camera does a better job than Redmi's.4. Customization: The UI has gestures, features and better options for accessibility than the previous generations of Samsung.5. No stutter/ lag: Using it for 3 days now, and faced no lag. Smooth experience when it comes to daily usage (can't say about gaming)6: Minimal Heating: Very less heating. Some people have complained about heating during calls. I haven't faced any.7. Call Clarity: The calls, the major purpose a phone serves are crystal clear, infact a better reception and a loud microphone (Note 7 Pro has issues with microphone, its not tooDislikes:1. Ads: Like MI, even this phone shows up ads randomly while using any app. Can be reduced, but can't be escaped from.2. Speaker Loudness: Satisfactory and decent but not very loud.3. Face recognition is fast, but not very fast. Also doesn't work at certain angles.4. Loss of detail in ultra wide camera5. No dark mode (black/ dark background for UI. I personally like it that way)6. Android Oreo in box, and no clue when Pie will be rolled out. Newer versions of Android tend to provide better functionality.

"I think no one checked the product before delivering to customers.. i have purchased it on 26th march and it got delivered on 30th march. I opened it with great excitement and really disappointed as its mic is not working.. if we put our hard earned money to purchase this phone but if u get defect piece how you will feel... i thought of filing a  formal complaint in civil court

"I wanted a budget friendly phone and I was lucky to have found one. Firstly, I was happy that it is a Samsung product which one can rely on. Secondly, it was falling under my budget of 14,990. I can say that I am very thankful for Samsung, for launching such a great phone. This phone has everything that one can ask for , be it good camera, battery, display, processor, be it anything, Samsung M30 fulfills your demand. Personally for me , I am highly impressed with its Battery power, it has 5000mah battery which is amazing. Now a days it is very difficult to get such a great battery life in a phone. It has 4gb RAM , which is one of best feature of this phone as myself being a game addict , i always wished for a phone in which i can enjoy playing games smoothly without lacking and Samsung M30 has made it possible. It has 3 cameras at the Back and one front camera as well which is pretty amazing. It's Infinity U display steals everything, it gives a premium feeling while using the phone. Samsung M30 is the best phone one can ask for. The design of the phone is amazing and I might not switch to some another phone for atleast sometime now.

For the extra 2000 bucks, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.When compared to the new and emerging competition like Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Galaxy M30 has its advantages (AMOLED display, HD streaming, software, battery, fast charging) and let downs (performance, primary rear camera, plastic body), but it should still largely bank on the Samsung brand value to win the bout. The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint. You could also look into stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50.*Pros*Excellent DisplayBattery backupSupports HD streamingDedicated card slotUSB Type-C port and fast charging*Cons*No notification lightNot for heavy gamingNo case cover in the boxplastic buildNote:-  no headphone, back cover, screen guard available in box only charger and sim ejector tool is their

"Sound quality is bad & apps are very slow running.I did not expect this from Samsung. I'm very sorry after taking the Samsung M30 while i'm a regulary customer for Samsung's last 7 years.
            "
"The new Samsung M30 has a whole lot of fabulous specifications . To start with , it provides a 6.4 inches of AMOLED display . It has a triple ultra wide camera which adds into its favour as no other phones offer something like this, makes you click amazing photographs which Im sure is a DSLR quality. Also an extra efficient battery of 5000 Mah plus the storing capacity of 128 GB which will help you play all your favourite games, watch high quality videos and you dont even run out of your gallery space. Overall it is the best suited option in the range of phones below 18,000 and you too can make a smart choice like me and get this phone!

"Perfect phone in this range nd Samsung as a brand is always a plus....a great buy. Display is 5 star nd i love the way the phone works no lag.

"Very bad phone guys. i will not reccommend this phone to anyone. I buy this phone for playing pubg n other games but this phone gets so much lag while playing pubg. Very bad performance of the processor.I request to return the device but amazon didn't return this. They connect my device to their system online and ask me to play pubg. I was playing and phone was lagging so much but their system didn't detect the lagging problem. So they refused to replacr the phone. Then i sell 1 day old device to 13000. Very bad phone.If you want to buy this for gaming then don't waste your money on this worst processor phone.If you don't play games then you can buy this. But i will not recommend this to anyone.
            "
"Phone is great, battery is not upto the mark, camera quality is pretty good, but the wide angle lens disappointed me. Speakers are outstanding. It takes around 2 hours to fully charge. Phone works smoothly, Highend games miss that touch, If you're a hardcore gamer, I'll recommend  Samsung A50.
            "
"The biggest mistake is to buy this phone, This model has a very bad hardware design in the display section. the display is not working and I replaced the item and the second phone which I bought is also not working after 20 days and Amazon says return period is over, now Samsung guys charge 6400 to change the display. (Dear Samsung try to respect the customers and their valuable money don't play trial and error game with us)I also enquired and found that many phones in Samsung M30 has this issue, this is clearly a trial and error piece from Samsung so that the future upcoming phone they can work on.Rest of the things like the camera and battery is fine since I am likely to be a tech guy the made a poor design in hardware and it is very unstable.Thanks for wasting my 18K, amazon should also think before the sell any products which can be purchase only on amazonNever  ever buy this phone

"Wouldn't recommend to buy. Think twice before buying this mobile.I am writing this review after using the mobile for more than 20 days. And I regret myself buying this mobile. I had great expectations on this mobile which came from Samsung. But in many aspects it failed to meet the expectations.I would go with a 3 star for this one.Cons:1.  The worst part of the mobile is the touch sensitivity. Touch sensitivity is very poor. Sometimes you need to touch the screen at least thrice or more operate the mobile. No one would really want to have such a kind of issue. Don't really understand why Samsung has manufactured such a bad touch sensor. Don't know how to get this issue fixed :(2. Samsung claims that this mobile comes with fast charging. Believe me, I haven't seen any such difference. I used 4 mobiles from Redmi series till now which didn't have fast charging facility and M30 takes the same time as Redmi to get charged completely.3. Despite of having 5,000 mah battery, the backup is not that great but manageable (Almost similar to Redmi series)4. When someone speaks using this mobile, you feel the vibration of voice from the back side (which in general will be observed in low priced speakers).5. Finger print sensor is not good. The sensor takes time to recognize the finger print. You might need to touch it twice some times.This mobile is not worth waiting and investing 15K. I am thinking to sell this off. Think twice before buying this mobile. Will try to update my observations after few more days.

"I bought this phone after a lot of consideration one obvious option was redmi note 7 pro.! But finally i made my choice and bought M30 6gb variant and after 3 days of uses i can say it is worth every penny you spend on this device.Pros:Display:You are not going to get this elegant display in this price range except M30Camera: rear camera quality is good but front camera is excellentBattery:It would last easily around 2 days if you are normal user. It get full charged in around 1hrs 40 minRam management is excellent. You will get around 108gb free out of 128. Built Quality is excellent and dosen't feel like plastic body. but you must buy a case because if you broke display it will be too expensive due to super Amoled displayCons:Android pie update is missing. I hope it will be available soon. Charging cable is too small.

"Samsung galaxy M30 is fully packed with all the necessity features which should be covered.The camera qualities are amazing .The phone is ultra light carrying such features.The battery life is amazing. Rear camera and display is going to be my next favorite for atleast next 2 years, talking about the the design it feels pretty amazing,display takes it to next level. The most amazing feature is face unlock i was not sure if the speed will be fast enough but believe me as soon you look at the screen it unlock within like half second and that's pretty impressive, if you're worried about storage well then don't worry because it has dedicated micro SD slot. Yes you heard it right it has a dedicated micro SD slot! So, y'all don't have to worry about storage anymore. The dolby atmos feature for Bluetooth devices and earphones impressed me allot. The phone overall is pretty amazing.I think ill not get better phone than this.

"Plus Point: Samsung has done a fabulous job of keeping the 3.5 mm Head phone jack even though they have type c USB for data and chargingThe best thing about Samsung M30 smartphone is its massive battery back up of Li-Po 5000mAh (Non removable) which comes with 15w fast battery charging. So no more waiting to charge your phone and abstaining use of it when out.Moving towards screen. The all mordern looking infinity V cut display is just icing on the cake [Its Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen] with 6.4 inches and a resolution of 2340x1080 (394 PPI). The triple rear cameras (13MP with an f/1.9 + 5MP with an f/2.2 + 5MP with an f/2.2) with ultra wide and depth sensor having LED flash, panorama, HDR features comes in an affordable price tag.The front camera with 16 MP resolution with HDR feature is also great for taking snaps. The 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage blue variant phone comes for 17,990 INR.The OS version of Samsung M30 is Android 8.1 (oreo). The sound quality of this phone in this price is best. The volume and the power button are on the right hand panel, and hybrid-SIM slot which has separate slots for two SIM cards (supporting Volte on both the sim) and a MicroSD card of up to 512GB. The smartphone comes with face unlock, fingerprint (rear mounted), accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass sensor. This phone full fills all the demands in such a low price.

"The Samsung M30 is a really great budget phone under 15,000.Also having a super AMOLED display in this segment is like heaven on earth.The camera quality is good even after zooming, the pictures doesn't lose it's details.The selfie camera is too amazing and it's much better with the live focus feature.The gradient look at the back of the phone makes it look much more premium.The exynos 7 chipset works excellent even when using the 4GB RAM variantEg. The face unlock, fingerprint sensor is quite responsive, playing PUBG on HD graphics is also preferable. I love this phone

Digital Dolby atmos to be provided for inbuilt speakers & speaker volume to be raised.Overall very good mobile. Hats off to samsung

The expandable storage is a godsend. I'm sure the day I head to college with my phone, I'll be the star of the group and my friends will keep asking me to take photos.

"The Samsung M30 is an absolutely brilliant phone at its price point. The biggest positives are it's Super AMOLED display and 5000 mAH battery. The display looks gorgeous under all lighting conditions and the colors literally pop. The battery easily lasts 1.5 days even with heavy usage. The phone is quite light and feels nice to hold.  Samsung's Android skin is nicely done and quite responsive. The only negatives I can think of are the plastic back,  but I'm not complaining as the pricing of this phone is very competitive. The other is the bloatware apps that come preinstalled via Iron Source. It's been quite a while I've been so excited about a new phone. Overall a fantastic buy at this price point.
            "
"I liked the product immensely as it satisfies a hardcore traveler who has only the mobile for company and M30 perfectly fits the bill with top notch quality at an affordable price. I would simply say the three most important feature anyone should experience in a mobile should be 1.Battery-im a hardcore browser and stays for a long long time 2.Camera quality- absolutely stunning and worth the penny(low light & normal light photo attached) 3.SAR value and the most important one,the prime reason for buying Samsung mobile as it is something which affects the health because of high Radiation and Samsung mobiles comes with very low SAR value and thus low radiation level unlike other Chinese brands. I would recommend Samsung anyday for its quality.If somebody says inferior about the product then seriously they must try to change their attitude or the product.
